# cc-click-queue
This is a Chrome extension to simulate an adoptable queue for the Click Exchange on clickcritters.com. This extension should work most on Chromium-based browsers, but Chrome 55 (released December 2016) is likely the oldest compatible version.
# Installation
1. Download all of these files by clicking **Clone or Download**, a green button near the top-right corner of the list of files. Choose **Download ZIP**.
2. Unzip the folder into a new folder on your computer.
3. In Chrome, go to the top right and click on the 3-dots menu. Go to **More tools > Extensions**.
4. Enable **Developer Mode**, which is located in the top right corner.
5. Click on the **Load unpacked** button.
6. Select the folder you just created.
7. Make sure this extension is enabled.
8. For best experience, it is also recommended that you pin this extension to the browser toolbar.
# Usage
1. Click on the extension icon to open the pop-up menu.
2. Click on **Edit Queue**.
3. Click on **Add Adoptables**.
4. From a separate window, drag and drop the images of the adoptables you want to add to the queue. Images can be dragged over one at a time, or multiple images can be selected at once by highlighting them.

5. On the queue page, enter the target level for these adoptables, and then click **Add to Queue**.
6. Click on **Start Queue**.

# Additional Notes
* If you **manually change the first adoptable** afterwards by doing any of the following,
   * moving another adoptable to the front of the queue
   * removing the first adoptable in the queue
   * using the "Sort All" menu

  then you need to click on **Start Queue** again. Otherwise, you may end up adding clicking the wrong adoptable in the Click Exchange.
* **This extension will not check that the adoptable you have selected in the Click Exchange is actually in the queue.** Disable this extension if you want to click another adoptable that is not in your queue.
